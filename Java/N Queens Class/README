Queens [-v] n

-v: to verbosely write out all possible combinations in array format (N columns, N values)
  ex: (10, 8, 7, 5, 3, 1, 9, 6, 4, 2) <-- Not necessarily a solution to 10 Queens!
  
 n: size of chessboard! n represents an n x n board. n must be an integer.
 
 This program works speedily up to 12 queens, where it takes a minute.
 Beyond that, It is slow.

This proram had orignally been written by me in the fall of 2015, during my first Java class, near the end of the quarter.
