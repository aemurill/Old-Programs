Was provided with Complex.java with functions left unimplemented (give or take a few, I do not remember if the parsing function was provided fully implemented).
Was tasked with implementing them.

ComplexTest was provided for testing the previous class.

file1 - file6 are sample files for use with testing.

Instructions for testing are within ComplexTest.java. Repeating them here for clarity.


//  Run the program by doing
//
//  % ComplexTest input_file output_file
//
//  An input file consists of 10 lines of text, with one complex number on 
//  each line.  The output file has the very same format, so you can use your 
//  output as input on another run.
//
//  Use the input file file1 to create the sequence file2, file3, file4, file5.
//  Each file in this sequence is the output of the previous file.  You can 
//  therefore test your Complex class by doing the following commands:
//
//  % make
//  % ComplexTest file1 f2
//  % ComplexTest f2 f3
//  % ComplexTest f3 f4
//  % ComplexTest f4 f5
//  
//  If your sequence f2, f3, f4, f5 is identical to my sequence file2, file3
//  file4, file5, then you pass the test.  You can check this using the Unix
//  command diff.  For instance, if you do
//
//  % diff file5 f5
//
//  and get no output, then there is no difference between files file5 and f5.
