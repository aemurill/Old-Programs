Was provided with Complex.java with functions left unimplemented (give or take a few, I do not remember if the parsing function was provided fully implemented).
Was tasked with implementing them.

ComplexTest was provided for testing the previous class.

file1 - file6 are sample files for use with testing.

Instructions for testing are within ComplexTest.java. Repeating them here for clarity.
