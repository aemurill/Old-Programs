Was provided with Complex.java with functions left unimplemented (give or take a few, I do not remember if the parsing function was provided fully implemented).
Was tasked with implementing them.

ComplexTest was provided for testing the previous class.

The correct output should be:

3/2
4/5
23/10
7/10
6/5
15/8
2/3
false
true
1
-1
0
1.5
-9/2
-9/2
Cannot create Rational with zero denominator
Cannot create reciprocal of zero
Cannot divide by zero

Initialization string for Rational must be: 'integer' or 'integer/integer'
Initialization string for Rational must be: 'integer' or 'integer/integer'
Initialization string for Rational must be: 'integer' or 'integer/integer'
Initialization string for Rational must be: 'integer' or 'integer/integer'
