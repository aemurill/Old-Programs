An Archive of Old Programs that I've written between September 2015 and June 2019, during my years at uni for projects.
This does not represent everythign I've ever written, obviously, just those that I hadn't used git with at the time AND thought were impressive enough to merit archiving.

A BIG WIP as I stumble through my old files and remember what things were meant to do:
  Commenting My Code was something I learned as time went on, so the older stuff is a little vague.
