The goal here was to take a Java progarm and redo it in C.


This programs takes a file written in the format:
N
a_1 b_1 [w_1]
a_2 b_2 [w_2]
a_3 b_3 [w_3]
...
a_N b_N [w_N]

where N is the number of vertices within a graph,  
a_x b_x is an edge going from integer a_x to b_x,
and w_1 is an optional value that represents the weight of said edge.

a_1 to a_N are numbers 1 to N respectively.

----
The program takes these values, and outputs 
```
Opened input.data for input.
n = N
m = V
1       [5, 4, 2, 3]
2       []
3       [4]
4       [6, 2, 6]
...
N       [1]
```

`java graph input.data` is an example of the behavior required.
