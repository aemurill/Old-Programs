 graph02:
  Similar output to Graph Edge Printer (V1), but can be used in either List or Vector mode.
  Must be called as `./graph02 [FLAG] input.file` where FLAG is either -L for List or -V for Vector.
  
  ex1 & ex2 are examples of valid input.
  the remaining examples are not.
 
 
 
 intVecTest:
  Checks that the Vector object (intVecNode) works properly in regards to:
    returning TOP
    returning X index
    returning SIZE
    returning CAPACITY
    returning an empty intVecNode
    pushing onto the Vector
  For some reason it doesn't test popping off the Vector. I do not remember quite why that was the case.
