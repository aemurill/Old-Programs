Fall 2016
Uses the Graph Edge Printer headers.

Does Depth First Search on graph, prints out node discovery time, finish time, and parent.
Inverts graph, then does DFS on resulting inverse, and prints out the same PLUS the DFS ROOT NODES (AKA the SCC leader of a Node).


compile with `[CCOMPILER] -Wall -Wextra scc03.c intVec.c loadGraph.c dfsTrace1.c dfsPhase2.c -o scc03`
run as  `./scc03 -V [-u] INPUTFILE`

For whatever reason at the time, the -V flag was mandatory.
The -u flag on the other hand enables an optional feature that, when loading the Graph Edges from a file, 
adds an inverted copy of every edge, if one does not already exist.

The following warning shows up. This is regretable.
```
dfsPhase2.c: In function ‘dfsPhase2’:
dfsPhase2.c:7:55: warning: unused parameter ‘n’ [-Wunused-parameter]
    7 | void dfsPhase2(char** color, IntVec* adjVertices, int n, int* discoverTime, int* finishTime,
      |                                                   ~~~~^
